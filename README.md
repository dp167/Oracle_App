# Oracle_App
Web browser app for android that allows users to create an oracle database through use, saving answers to their questions 

the purpose of this app is to create a streamlined tool for storing the questions asked on the internet and the ansers/solutions that were found 
I find my self constantly saving hundreds of browser tabs on my phone attempting to save information that I do not want to loose and this app is made to solve that problem

step 1:
im hoping to have it set up so that when an answer is highlighted in the form of text, wether URL or in-page-text a prompt will be displayed to the user allowing them to store the answer of there question to the question asked in an array

step 2:
create Another screen view to give the user a page to search there own questions with the answers in parallell 

step 3a:
Have this app built out in to a database that can store multiple users answers from different apps in to a shared database


step 3b: create web client for accessing the data produced by users
